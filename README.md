# Gun Sprint

- Gun Sprint is a famous hyper-casual game created by KAYAC Inc.
- This game includes gun movement by shooting bullets and smashing cubes and aliens.
- I used a blender for cubes and cubes debris, mixamo for alien dancing animation, cinemachine for camera movement, and unity assets store for the rest of the assets.
